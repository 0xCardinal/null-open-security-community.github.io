Vote of Thanks :
Mr. Tungar thanked the Corporates, Dignities and NULL members present for the Meet.

We null members had a good long discussions with Mr.Tungar on their day today challanges, non-cooperation, loose operations of IT and Telecom industry etc.  He also discussed a famous case where a person was victim of digital evidences which were against him and how they solved the case based on their experience with humans and not with machine. We had a great time with him.

With sips of coffe, crackles of wafers and sweetness of Gulabjaumns, we were indulged in networking with many other eminent IT personalities present at Cop-Tech.

It was a great event. We were amazed by the humbleness of Police department and there drive to achieve technical excellence right from operations to dealing politely with tax payers.

Dr. Satyapal Singh told

>“Control room daily recieves thousands of calls. 75% of which are irrevelent, miss guiding or just to ask some lame address. But still would like our force to work under cool and improve on their soft skills.”

Obviously this event has increased my respect for Police force and has motivited me (rather all nulls) to contribute in this drive called COP-Tech…

Enjoy,
