title: First official null meet
---

It was really good to see that Pune has a lot of potential. A lot of security enthusiasts showed up at the first NULL meet. The best part was that our first meet happened at ClubHack – India’s premier hacking convention, so much for a kickstart :-).

**Venue**: ClubHack 2008, Room-B, 5th Floor, ICC Trade Towers, SB Road, Pune.

**Date & Time**: 7th Dec 2008 14:00 hrs
