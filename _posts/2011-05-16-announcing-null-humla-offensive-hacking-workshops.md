title: Announcing null Humla – Offensive Hacking workshops
---

Humla (meaning attack in Hindi) is a completely hands-on workshop with the clear focus on learning the tools, techniques and approaches of offensive hacking using simulated servers and networks.

Humla is different from a normal null meet in its focus and duration. The focus is on learning specific tools and techniques and the duration is about 5-6 hours of hands-on work.

## null Humla Basics

* **null Humla events are invite only**
Keeping them exclusive allows for keeping the logistics simple, the course content focussed and the interactions very engaging.

* **null Humla events are completely hands-on**
The idea is to learn offensive hacking, therefore everyone is expected to come prepared and do the hands-on in a group.

* **null Humla events require you to get your laptop**
There is no pairing up while doing hands-on. The point is to ensure that you actually get the practice while learning.

* **null Humla events are about 5-6 hours**
This is an ideal time to get all 10 people up to speed and comfortable. This amount of time allows for everyone to become comfortable with the topic at hand.

* **A null Humla event is led by 1-2 champions in that particular topic**
One or two hackers who have the experience and skills are assigned as Humla Champions for a particular topic. They are completely responsible for the course content and ensuring that all the group members learn the concepts and the attacks.
