### Take up the initiative, start a null chapter in your city
 
We are starting the new era of our open security community as null 2.0 and we would like to make an open appeal to all the people who want to be a part of this wonderful security community.

<!--more-->

Whatever null is today, it is due to all the awesome work that is done since day one, by the volunteers. Most of the credit of this volunteer-driven community goes to the concept of having null city chapters at different places around the globe. All these null chapters are basically the backbones of this open security community and with the new era of null 2.0, we want to maximise our footprints by encouraging & promoting null chapters to each possible corner and make it as huge as possible. It is a dream of ours to have a null chapter in  every city of the world. We currently have 15 active chapters running.

### Guidelines to start the chapter in your city:

If you see the potential and the opportunity in your city to start a new null chapter you just need to follow some guidelines:

* Share the contact details for yourself and at least two more people interested in starting a new null chapter. (included in the form)
* Go through the checklist we will share to do a pre-null meet.
* Once you are clear about the checklist, go ahead, and plan for a pre-null meet.
* Once the meet  is done, confirm all the checklist items we require for documentation.

We will go through the pre meetups conducted by you in the city, reach out to you with some more questions and based on the interaction outcome, a new null chapter can be started in your city.
