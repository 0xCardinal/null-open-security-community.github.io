So, yesterday was a day full of subtle surprises! We received our consignment of null volunteer t-shirts in the evening. These t-shirts will be given to all the awesome null volunteers who have won themselves a free VIP pass for nullcon 2015 for being awesome and volunteering for null activities in 2014.
